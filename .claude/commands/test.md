Build the application using Maven and run it. If any errors occur during build or runtime, immediately start fixing them.

Steps:
1. Run `./mvnw clean package` to build the application
2. If build succeeds, run the application using `./mvnw javafx:run`
3. If any errors occur, analyze them and fix immediately
4. Repeat until application builds and runs successfully
